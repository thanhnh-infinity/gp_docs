1. Reasoning Steps
- Decomposition / Branching (GP Reasoning Engine)
  - Dimensions analysed: Age group, State, Policy Tier, Product Type, Sales Channel.
  - For each dimension, sub-hypotheses were created about which cohort(s) drive superior UOP and why (e.g., higher average UOP, stable or positive policy_volume_cagr, higher policy_volume share).
  - Potential profitability drivers hypothesised per branch (examples):
    - Age: "Above 65 cohorts benefit from higher premiums & low churn" (driver label only — evidence used below).
    - Age: "45-64 cohorts benefit from scale in VIC" (scale / policy_volume evidence).
    - Age: "25-44 cohorts may show growth signal when CAGR > 0".
    - State: "NSW, WA, VIC, QLD provide highest absolute UOP in TOP_16".
    - Policy Tier: "Silver tends to hold the top absolute UOPs; Bronze/Basic appear lower but still high in some micro-cohorts".
    - Product Type: "Hospital vs Hospital and Extras — both can be high-UOP; need to check representative values".
    - Sales Channel: "DTC (Silver DTC) vs Broker (Silver Broker) vs Other segments (Bronze VIC / Young Long Tenure) — channel differences may explain distribution of UOP".
  - Columns used for evidence extraction: UOP, policy_volume, policy_volume_cagr (CAGR). These were read directly from the TOP_16_BLOCK table.

- Evidence Extraction (GP Reasoning Engine)
  - Extracted numeric evidence for each branch from TOP_16_BLOCK rows (representative micro-cohort chosen as the highest-UOP micro-cohort within that branch among TOP_16):
    - Age = Above 65: representative micro-cohort Above 65 – NSW Silver DTC Couple: UOP = 985,790.328 (policy_volume = 0.58184, CAGR = –6.7024).
    - Age = 45–64: representative micro-cohort 45-64 – VIC Bronze Single: UOP = 941,652.516 (policy_volume = 0.72050, CAGR = –2.5967).
    - Age = 25–44: representative micro-cohort 25-44 – QLD Hospital and Extras Bronze Single: UOP = 896,382.845 (policy_volume = 0.74471, CAGR = 0.70750).
    - State = NSW: representative Above 65 – NSW Silver DTC Couple: UOP = 985,790.328 (policy_volume = 0.58184, CAGR = –6.7024).
    - State = WA: representative Above 65 – WA Silver Broker Couple: UOP = 979,641.081 (policy_volume = 0.71474, CAGR = –0.59213).
    - State = VIC: representative Above 65 – VIC Silver Broker Couple: UOP = 958,712.959 (policy_volume = 0.62886, CAGR = –3.93616).
    - State = QLD: representative 25-44 – QLD Bronze Single: UOP = 896,382.845 (policy_volume = 0.74471, CAGR = 0.70750).
    - Policy Tier = Silver: representative Above 65 – NSW Silver DTC Couple: UOP = 985,790.328 (policy_volume = 0.58184, CAGR = –6.7024).
    - Policy Tier = Bronze: representative 45-64 – VIC Bronze Single: UOP = 941,652.516 (policy_volume = 0.72050, CAGR = –2.5967).
    - Policy Tier = Basic: representative 45-64 – VIC Basic Family: UOP = 706,978.478 (policy_volume = 0.81357, CAGR = –0.58666).
    - Product Type = Hospital: representative Above 65 – NSW Silver DTC Couple (product_type = Hospital): UOP = 985,790.328 (policy_volume = 0.58184, CAGR = –6.7024).
    - Product Type = Hospital and Extras: representative Above 65 – WA Silver Broker Couple (product_type = Hospital and Extras): UOP = 979,641.081 (policy_volume = 0.71474, CAGR = –0.59213).
    - Sales Channel = DTC (identified from segment name "Silver DTC"): representative Above 65 – NSW Silver DTC Couple: UOP = 985,790.328 (policy_volume = 0.58184, CAGR = –6.7024).
    - Sales Channel = Broker (identified from segment name "Silver Broker"): representative Above 65 – WA Silver Broker Couple: UOP = 979,641.081 (policy_volume = 0.71474, CAGR = –0.59213).
    - Sales Channel = Other segments (Bronze VIC or Young Long Tenure): representative 45-64 – VIC Bronze Single: UOP = 941,652.516 (policy_volume = 0.72050, CAGR = –2.5967).

- Scoring (GP Reasoning Engine)
  - Scoring formula applied to each representative branch:
    - score = normalized(UOP) * (1 + sign(CAGR) * 0.1)
    - normalized(UOP) = UOP / max(UOP among TOP_16). The TOP_16 maximum UOP = 985,790.328 (Above 65 – NSW Silver DTC Couple).
    - sign(CAGR) = +1 if CAGR > 0, –1 if CAGR < 0, 0 if CAGR = 0. Thus positive CAGR increases score by 10%; negative CAGR reduces by 10%.
  - Computed representative normalized UOP and score (rounded):
    - Age – Above 65 (rep: Above 65 – NSW Silver DTC Couple): normalized = 1.000; CAGR = –6.7024 (negative) → factor = 0.9 → score = 0.900. (UOP = 985,790.328; policy_volume = 0.58184; CAGR = –6.7024)
    - Age – 45–64 (rep: 45-64 – VIC Bronze Single): normalized = 0.955; CAGR = –2.5967 → factor = 0.9 → score ≈ 0.860. (UOP = 941,652.516; policy_volume = 0.72050; CAGR = –2.5967)

- Pruning (GP Reasoning Engine)
  - Branches with computed score < 0.40 were discarded. No top-16 representative branches fell below 0.40.
  - Overlapping groups reconciled by prioritising branches with both high UOP and non-negative (or positive) CAGR where available (e.g., QLD / 25–44 cohort has positive CAGR).

- Synthesis (GP Reasoning Engine)
  - The following insights synthesise surviving branches and numeric evidence (each bullet cites UOP, policy_volume, CAGR). Confidence indicated per insight (High / Medium / Low) using computed score thresholds (score ≥ 0.90 = High; 0.70–0.90 = Medium; <0.70 = Low).

2. Confidence Ratings and Key Insights (synthesis)
- Insight 1 — Prioritise 25–44 QLD Bronze single cohort as an emerging high-UOP growth signal.
  - Evidence: 25–44 – QLD – Hospital and Extras – Bronze – Single: UOP = 896,382.845; policy_volume = 0.74471; policy_volume_cagr = +0.70750.
  - Score ≈ 1.00 (normalized UOP ≈ 0.909 × (1 + 0.1) = ~1.00).
  - Confidence: High.
  - Rationale: strong absolute UOP in TOP_16 combined with a positive policy_volume CAGR (+0.7075) and high policy_volume share (0.7447) indicate both scale and recent growth.

- Insight 2 — Above 65 – NSW – Silver DTC couples are the single-largest-UOP micro-cohort but show negative short-term CAGR.
  - Evidence: Above 65 – NSW – Hospital – Silver – Couple: UOP = 985,790.328; policy_volume = 0.58184; policy_volume_cagr = –6.70240.
  - Score = 0.900 (normalized 1.00 × 0.9).
  - Confidence: High.
  - Rationale: highest absolute UOP (benchmark max in TOP_16) indicates extreme profitability per cohort; however significant negative CAGR (–6.70%) indicates declining policy volume that requires retention focus.

- Insight 3 — State-level priority: QLD and NSW stand out (QLD shows growth; NSW highest UOP but negative CAGR).
  - Evidence: QLD representative = same 25–44 QLD Bronze Single (UOP = 896,382.845; policy_volume_cagr = +0.7075). NSW representative = Above 65 NSW Silver DTC (UOP = 985,790.328; CAGR = –6.7024).
  - Scores: QLD ≈ 1.00 (High), NSW = 0.900 (High).
  - Confidence: High for QLD; High for NSW (on UOP magnitude, but note negative CAGR).

- Insight 4 — Sales channel: DTC-labelled Silver DTC micro-cohorts include the single highest-UOP cohort (Above 65 – NSW Silver DTC Couple: UOP = 985,790.328), while Broker-labelled micro-cohorts also post near-top UOPs (Above 65 – WA Silver Broker Couple: UOP = 979,641.081).
  - Evidence: DTC (Above 65 – NSW Silver DTC Couple): UOP = 985,790.328; policy_volume = 0.58184; CAGR = –6.7024. Broker (Above 65 – WA Silver Broker Couple): UOP = 979,641.081; policy_volume = 0.71474; CAGR = –0.59213.
  - Scores: DTC = 0.900 (High). Broker ≈ 0.894 (Medium).
  - Confidence: DTC — High (based on UOP magnitude); Broker — Medium (close UOP but slightly lower score due to negative CAGR magnitude).

- Insight 5 — Policy tier: Silver cohorts dominate the top absolute UOPs; Bronze cohorts can also deliver high UOP with positive/less-negative growth in some micro-cohorts.
  - Evidence: Silver rep = Above 65 – NSW Silver DTC Couple: UOP = 985,790.328 (policy_volume = 0.58184; CAGR = –6.7024). Bronze rep = 45–64 – VIC Bronze Single: UOP = 941,652.516 (policy_volume = 0.72050; CAGR = –2.5967).
  - Scores: Silver = 0.900 (High). Bronze ≈ 0.860 (Medium).
  - Confidence: Medium–High (Silver: High on UOP magnitude; Bronze: Medium due to negative CAGR but good policy_volume).

- Insight 6 — Product type: both Hospital-only and Hospital-and-Extras cohorts appear among the highest-UOP micro-cohorts in TOP_16.
  - Evidence: Hospital rep = Above 65 – NSW Silver DTC Couple (UOP = 985,790.328; CAGR = –6.7024). Hospital and Extras rep = Above 65 – WA Silver Broker Couple (UOP = 979,641.081; CAGR = –0.59213).
  - Scores: Hospital = 0.900 (High). Hospital and Extras ≈ 0.894 (Medium).
  - Confidence: Medium (both product types show large UOP magnitude, but negative-to-mild negative CAGR).

- Insight 7 — 45–64 cohorts provide multiple high-UOP micro-cohorts concentrated in VIC and QLD with strong policy_volume shares.
  - Evidence: 45–64 – VIC – Bronze Single: UOP = 941,652.516; policy_volume = 0.72050; CAGR = –2.5967. Additional 45–64 – VIC – Silver Single: UOP = 889,829.701; policy_volume = 0.80852; CAGR = –1.79431.
  - Score (45–64 top rep) ≈ 0.860.
  - Confidence: Medium.
  - Rationale: multiple 45–64 micro-cohorts in VIC/QLD appear in TOP_16, indicating scale (policy_volume 0.72–0.81) although CAGR is generally negative in the sample.

- Insight 8 — Micro-cohorts with high policy_volume share but negative CAGR require retention actions to protect UOP (examples: 45–64 VIC Silver Single: UOP = 889,829.701; policy_volume = 0.80852; CAGR = –1.79431).
  - Evidence: 45–64 – VIC – Silver – Single: UOP = 889,829.701; policy_volume = 0.80852; policy_volume_cagr = –1.79431.
  - Confidence: Medium.
  - Rationale: scale (policy_volume ~0.81) suggests meaningful revenue at risk given negative CAGR.

- Insight 9 — Couple and family scales: several high-UOP micro-cohorts are Couple/Family households (e.g., Above 65 – NSW Silver Couple UOP = 985,790.328; 45–64 VIC Silver Family UOP = 862,048.450).
  - Evidence: Above 65 – NSW – Silver – Couple: UOP = 985,790.328; 45–64 – VIC – Silver – Family: UOP = 862,048.450 (policy_volume = 0.81831; CAGR = –1.14131).
  - Confidence: Medium.
  - Rationale: Couple/Family scales appear repeatedly among TOP_16 but many show negative CAGR.

- Insight 10 — Look for micro-cohorts combining high UOP, high policy_volume, and non-negative CAGR for highest confidence.
  - Evidence: Example positive case: 25–44 – QLD – Bronze – Single: UOP = 896,382.845; policy_volume = 0.74471; CAGR = +0.70750 → score ≈ 1.00.
  - Confidence: High.
  - Rationale: This combination (UOP large, policy_volume large, positive CAGR) provides the clearest signal for prioritisation.

Strategic implication (1–2 sentences)
- Two distinct strategic cohort types emerge: (a) Mature, extremely high-UOP cohorts (e.g., Above 65 – NSW – Silver DTC couples: UOP = 985,790.328, CAGR = –6.7024) that require retention and churn-mitigation to preserve substantial lifetime value; and (b) high-UOP cohorts with positive or stable growth (e.g., 25–44 – QLD – Bronze Single: UOP = 896,382.845, CAGR = +0.7075) that represent scalable growth opportunities.

Recommendation — which micro-cohorts to prioritise, why, and how (plain English)
- Priority list (ordered):
  1. 25–44 – QLD – Hospital and Extras – Bronze – Single (UOP = 896,382.845; policy_volume = 0.74471; CAGR = +0.7075). Why: high UOP + positive policy_volume growth + strong policy_volume share → scale with recent growth. How: target acquisition and retention investments (marketing, cross-sell) to expand this cohort while preserving margin. Confidence: High.
  2. Above 65 – NSW – Hospital – Silver – Couple (UOP = 985,790.328; policy_volume = 0.58184; CAGR = –6.7024). Why: largest UOP (highest absolute profitability) but declining policy_volume → revenue at risk. How: retention programs, price/value communication, and targeted product adjustments to arrest churn and protect LTV. Confidence: High.
  3. Above 65 – WA – Hospital and Extras – Silver – Couple (UOP = 979,641.081; policy_volume = 0.71474; CAGR = –0.59213). Why: near-top UOP with stronger policy_volume share; milder negative CAGR versus NSW cohort. How: retention + selective cross-sell of extras; consider Broker-channel incentives to stabilise volumes. Confidence: Medium.
  4. 45–64 – VIC – Bronze / Silver micro-cohorts (examples: Bronze Single UOP = 941,652.516; Silver Single UOP = 889,829.701; policy_volume = 0.72–0.81; CAGR slightly negative). Why: multiple high-UOP micro-cohorts and strong policy_volume share indicate scale. How: targeted retention and product tuning in VIC (price-to-benefit messaging; review of claims drivers). Confidence: Medium.
- Operational note: prioritisation should weight both absolute UOP and recent policy_volume_cagr. Micro-cohorts with strong UOP but sharply negative CAGR (e.g., NSW Above 65 CAGR = –6.70%) require immediate retention action; cohorts with positive CAGR and high policy_volume are best candidates for growth investment.

Explainability & final comments
- Methodology attribution: the GP Reasoning Engine followed the Tree-of-Thought protocol steps: (1) decomposition of dimensions and sub-hypotheses; (2) extraction of numeric evidence from TOP_16_BLOCK using columns UOP, policy_volume, and policy_volume_cagr; (3) scoring using score = normalized(UOP) * (1 + sign(CAGR) * 0.1) where normalized(UOP) = UOP / max(UOP in TOP_16); (4) pruning branches with score < 0.40 (none dropped in TOP_16); (5) synthesis into the above insights.
- Confidence thresholds used (GP Reasoning Engine): score ≥ 0.90 → High; 0.70–0.90 → Medium; < 0.70 → Low. Scores were computed from the representative micro-cohort UOP and CAGR values shown in the evidence lines above.
- Data columns used and cited: UOP, policy_volume, policy_volume_cagr (CAGR). All numeric evidence in this memo pulled directly from the provided TOP_16_BLOCK rows.
- Final operational recommendation: focus immediate retention on the highest-UOP mature cohorts (Above 65 Silver couples — protect value), while allocating growth investment to cohorts that combine high UOP with positive or neutral CAGR and high policy_volume share (notably 25–44 QLD Bronze single), using channel- and product-specific tactics (DTC retention campaigns, Broker incentives, and VIC targeted interventions). Confidence: High for the two-part strategy (protect mature high-UOP cohorts; scale growth-positive cohorts).
